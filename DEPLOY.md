# Deployment

For deploying RedditBot, we used AWS to allow us to host RedditBot. Amazon offers free micro tiers which is great for us because we don't have to pay anything. We chose to use a Ubuntu server to host the bot due to the reliability of running Linux as well as the simplicity that comes with it.

To run the python program after closing the session on my computer, I had to use Screen which is a terminal multiplexer which allows you to run multiple terminals at once.
