# Process Milestone


## First Iteration - (Monday Mar 29  Sunday Apr 11)

4/5/2021- Today we created our Progress Board for the project. We created three tasks to start the project: Setup Server, Setting up Reddit API, and Setup Basic Discord Bot. We plan to get the first section of the project done by Sunday, April 11, 2021.

4/8/2021- Today we delegated the tasks that need to be done and talked about how we will approach each task. We tried to fairly partition the work among the three group members by estimating how long each task will take and splitting the work equally. We choose to undergo the tasks that we felt most comfortable with. Christian will be working on setting up the server necessary for the Bot. Kushal will work on the Reddit API. Spencer will work on setting up a Discord bot. We also familiarized ourselves with the Progress Board which we will be using throughout the project. We also delegated complexity points to the tasks on the board. 


4/11/2021 - We discussed our progress for each task that we were working on. Starting with Christian, he was able to setup a Ubuntu server using AWS and run a simple python script to test that the environment was setup properly. He used PuTTy to connect to the server using ssh, and transferred over necessary files using FileZilla. Overall the task was not that challenging however, he had issues connecting to the server initially since he had to create secret and public keys to connect to it. AWS provides free tier servers which is great for a project like this because it allows us to not worry about paying to run the bot. Over the course of this iteration Kushal worked on making a python script that gathers data from Reddit using Reddit's API called PRAW. In order to do this, he had to create a deveopment app within Reddit to submit GET requests. This was initially hard because it was confusing to gather the private key necessary for the API. Nonetheless, he was able to get the script working correctly. He used Jupyter Notebook to visualize the dataset.
