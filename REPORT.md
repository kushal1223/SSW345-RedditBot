## Problem Solved
Considering the scope of the internet, a lot of sites offer information to a user. One website that is considered to be a hub for almost any type of information is Reddit. Reddit is used by millions of people daily, just like the telecommunication platform Discord. This platform allows users to communicate with friends via text and voice chat. Currently, there is no method to share large amounts of information from Reddit on Discord quickly and efficiently. Since Discord is one of the biggest communication platforms, there should be a way to share information from one of the largest information platforms in a fast and concise fashion. RedditBot allows information on Reddit to be shared among other Discord users without anyone needing to leaving Discord.

## Primary Features

### '-r help'
After installing RedditBot onto the user’s server, the user needs to be able to see the list of commands available to them. To do this, they can simply type “-r help” to see a list of all available commands.

### '-r top'
The top command will return the top ten posts on the home page of Reddit.com. This command will embed links to the original posts within the title of the post and will display the author of the post, the number of upvotes on the post, and the subreddit where the post was originally posted.
