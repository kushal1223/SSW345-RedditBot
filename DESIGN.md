<h1>Problem Statement:
  
  <h3>Considering the scope of the internet, a lot of sites offer information to a user. One website that is considered to be a hub for almost any type of information is Reddit.
  Reddit is used by millions of people daily, just like the telecommunication platform Discord. This platform allows users to communicate with friends via text and voice chat.
  Currently, there is no method to share large amounts of information from Reddit on Discord quickly and efficiently. Since Discord is one of the biggest communication platforms,
  there should be a way to share information from one of the largest information platforms in a fast and concise fashion.
